Welcome to the **S**ignal, **I**nformation, **I**nference, and **L**earning (**SIIL**) lab! 
We are a research group based at the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/), Duke University. The group is headed by Prof. [Christ D. Richmond](https://ece.duke.edu/people/christ-richmond/).

**Brief Bio**: Christ D. Richmond is a Professor in Duke ECE where he is Director of the Signals, Information, Inference, and Learning Group. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and an internationally recognized expert in adaptive array processing with application to radar, sonar, and communications. Prior to joining Duke University, he was a Professor in ECEE at Arizona State University. Before that, he was a Senior Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Advanced Sensor Techniques Group where his research involved the development and analysis of adaptive algorithms for detectionand parameter estimation, performance bounding for radar/sonar, communications,and passive RF geolocation systems.

**Research topics**: 
The Signals, Information, Inference, and Learning (SIIL) Group focuses on thetheory, application, and practice of statistical signal and array processing. Our goalis to advance technology for existing and emerging next generation systemsthrough innovative algorithm development, solid theory and analysis, performancebounding, and experimental validation of concepts. Multisensor / multichannelapplications and topics of interest include but are not limited to
- Cooperative Radar-Communications (Shared-Spectrum / RF Convergence)
- Cognitive MIMO Radar / Sonar
- Machine and Deep Learning
- Bayesian Sparse Vector Recovery
- Information Theoryâ€“Estimation Theory Interplay
- Geolocation (positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT))
- Robust Adaptive Filtering / Beamforming
- Adaptive Radar Detection and Estimation
- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Image Change Detection
- Robust Parameter Estimation and Bounds Under Model Misspecification
- Communication Over Dynamic Channels
- Adaptive MIMO Communications
